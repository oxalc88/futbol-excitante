## Last accepted objective

CPU-MULTI-PLAYER — CPU adapter now uses controlledPlayerId to find its controlled player instead of blindly using players[0]. Per-slot CPU adapters in browser mode pass controlledPlayerId through buildCpuObservation. Fallback to players[0] for backward compatibility. 12 new tests (CPU-MULTIPLAYER-001 through 004), 92/92 CPU adapter tests, 1224/1224 full suite.
