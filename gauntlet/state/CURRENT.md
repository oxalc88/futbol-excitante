## Last accepted objective

MATCH-GOAL-KICK — Goal kick set piece: ball crossing a goal line outside the posts with the attacking team's last touch awards a goal kick to the defending team (`lastTouchTeam !== defendingTeam` branch, complementary to the corner-kick branch). New `goal-kick` MatchPhase with parallel state fields, ball placed at the goal area (±47, y clamped ±9.16 preserving exit side), taker = closest defending player, teammates spread, attackers outside the area, 60-tick countdown auto-execute kicking upfield to the nearest receiver with `goal-kick-executed` event, state reset. Extends the MATCH-SET-PIECE / MATCH-CORNER-KICK / MATCH-THROW-IN infrastructure. All coefficients provisional. No PES claims. 19 unit + 14 integration tests, full node suite 1868/1868, browser 86/86. HEADLESS audit PASS.
