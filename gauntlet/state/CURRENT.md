## Last accepted objective

CPU-ATTACKING-ORGANIZATION — Structured CPU attacking patterns: overlapping runs (wide carriers trigger lateral overlap), spacing maintenance (10-15m between attackers), delayed forward runs (20-tick delay for onside simulation), and cross/through-ball decision logic (wide → cross, central → through-ball). CPU adapter only. All constants provisional. No PES claims. 11/11 attacking organization tests, 86/86 browser tests. HEADLESS audit PASS.
