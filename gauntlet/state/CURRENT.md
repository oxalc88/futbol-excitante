## Last accepted objective

CPU-BASIC-FORMATION — Formation blend in CPU defense mode: when ball is beyond 20m, players gradually shift toward a formation position 20% toward their own goal (linear blend from pure chase at 20m to pure formation at 40m). 22 formation-specific tests, 1278/1278 full suite pass.
